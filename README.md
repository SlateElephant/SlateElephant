- 👋 Hi, I’m @SlateElephant
- 👀 I’m interested in games, and everything to do with creating them!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ for Unreal Engine. It's something that I've been wanting to do for a while, just haven't taken the plunge, until now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game mechanics, and projects that will help introduce me to more, and more, C++ concepts, specifically within UE4.
- 📫 How to reach me message me here on GitHub, or email me at: ryanhillartist@gmail.com
